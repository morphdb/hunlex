Hunlex

What is Hunlex? (see reference manual for more)

HunLex offers a description language, ie., a formalism for specifying a base
lexicon and morphological rules which describe a language's morphology. This
description which is stored in textual format serves as your primary resources
that represents your knowledge about the morphology and lexicon of the language
in question.
 Now, providing a resource-specification language is rather useless in itself.
Hunlex is able to process these primary resources and create the type of
resources that are used by some real-time word-level analysis tools. If you
create these from your primary resources you might call them secondary
resources. These provide the the language-specific knowledge to a variety of
word-level analysis tools.
At present, most importantly, Hunlex provides the language specific resources
for the HunTools word-level analysis toolkit see Huntools. This package
contains the MorphBase library of word-analysis routines such as spell-checker,
stemmer, morphological analyzer/generator and their standalone executable
wrappers. Therefore, your single Hunlex description of your favourite language
will enable you to perform spell-checking, stemming, and morphological analysis
for that language, which is more than useful.
 In addition to the HunTools routines, other software which use ispell-type
resources will be able to use Hunlex's output. Among these are myspell, an
open-source spell-checker (also used in Open Office http://www.openoffice.org,
see Myspell), or jmorph, a superfast java morphological analyzer (see Jmorph).
